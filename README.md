# 👋 Hi, I'm Yvonne Arteaga

🔐 I’m a recent B.S. Cybersecurity graduate with a love for digital forensics, Python scripting, and network security.

💻 I’m currently working on hands-on projects like log analysis, threat detection, and automating network traffic analysis with Wireshark.

🌐 I’m also interested in networking and security engineering and am excited to grow in areas like infrastructure protection, configuration, and network defense.

🌱 Always learning—especially in cloud security, incident response, and secure coding practices.

📚 Currently building out my GitHub with class-based and personal cybersecurity projects.

🎯 Looking to grow into a cyber defense, analyst, or network security engineering role where I can continue to learn and protect people in a meaningful way.

📫 You can reach me at: arteaga.yvonne88@gmail.com

✨ Fun fact: I left UPS after 18 years to chase this dream and I’m just getting started!
